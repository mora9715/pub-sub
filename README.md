# Publishâ€“Subscribe pattern

The project provides a simple pub/sub implementation using Apache Kafka as message broker.


## How to run
Use a provided `docker-compose.yml` for a pre-configured services setup.

It starts a `publisher` and two `subscribers`.

Once all the services are booted up, take a look at `first_subscriber`, `second_subscriber` and `publisher` services logs.
